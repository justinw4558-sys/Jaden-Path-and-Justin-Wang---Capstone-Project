# Project Timeline

This timeline outlines the remaining phases of the portfolio analysis internship and capstone project. Remaining work focuses on analysis, synthesis, strategy, and presentation. Each week has a reviewable deliverable.

## Week 1: Jan 19-25
**Focus:** Planning & sequencing the remaining work

- Confirm final project scope, priorities, and success criteria given progress to date
- Align on how existing spreadsheet outputs will feed into upcoming analyses
- Sequence major deliverables (geo scan, cost analysis, ranking, acquisition framework) and identify dependencies

**Deliverable:** Finalized workplan and sequencing roadmap for the remainder of the project

## Week 2: Jan 26-31
**Focus:** Portfolio depth & early signals

- Review portfolio-wide KPI outputs to understand overall dispersion
- Identify early patterns worth deeper investigation (by asset type, size, location)
- Draft initial hypotheses around performance, costs, and geography
- Prep data views needed for geographic and cost analysis

**Deliverable:** Initial portfolio diagnostics summary and hypothesis list

## Weeks 3-4: Feb 2-14
**Focus:** Geographic scan & opportunity mapping

- Conduct portfolio-wide geographic scan (submarkets, clustering, spatial context)
- Build opportunity map highlighting geographic over- and under-performance
- Link location patterns to rent levels, margins, and expense behavior
- Document geographic insights that may influence future acquisition thinking

**Deliverable:** Geographic scan and opportunity map with supporting commentary

## Week 5: Feb 16-21
**Focus:** Cost structure & efficiency review

- Analyze expense categories across the portfolio to identify cost drivers
- Identify assets with structurally high vs. potentially controllable costs
- Explore data-backed cost reduction or efficiency opportunities
- Flag recurring expense patterns to revisit in later strategy work

**Deliverable:** Cost structure findings and preliminary efficiency opportunities summary

## Week 6: Feb 23-28
**Focus:** Asset-level synthesis & ranking

- Synthesize performance, geographic, and cost findings at the asset level
- Rank buildings by strengths and weaknesses using a stoplight-style model (green / yellow / red)
- Clarify which assets are operationally strong vs. structurally challenged
- Use rankings to inform which properties warrant deeper case-study analysis

**Deliverable:** Portfolio stoplight ranking and asset-level synthesis

## Spring Break: Mar 2-6
**Focus:** Buffer / validation week

- Review and stress-test assumptions developed to date
- Light cleanup and refinement of visuals and tables

## Weeks 7-8: Mar 9-21
**Focus:** Case study development

- Select representative overperforming and underperforming properties
- Develop detailed case studies grounded in KPI, cost, and geographic data
- Translate stoplight rankings into asset-specific narratives
- Prepare analytical foundation for comparative and historical analysis

**Deliverable:** Draft case study analyses for selected properties

## Week 9: Mar 23-28
**Focus:** Updated comparative analysis

- Rebuild Brent Sprenkle's analysis using updated portfolio data
- Compare historical conclusions with current findings
- Identify what insights remain valid and what has materially changed
- Position this analysis as validation and evolution of prior thinking

**Deliverable:** Updated, data-backed version of Brent Sprenkle's analysis

## Week 10: Mar 30-Apr 4
**Focus:** Translating insights into an acquisition lens

- Synthesize portfolio learnings into strategic implications
- Build an initial skeleton for what ideal future acquisitions should look like
- Define characteristics to seek or avoid based on internal performance data
- Ensure acquisition logic is clearly grounded in observed strengths and weaknesses

**Deliverable:** Initial acquisition framework / ideal-buy skeleton

## Weeks 11-12: Apr 6-18
**Focus:** Acquisition research & refinement

- Research potential property types or markets aligned with the acquisition skeleton
- Refine acquisition criteria and screening logic
- Stress-test how potential buys would perform against portfolio benchmarks
- Begin translating research into recommendation-ready insights

**Deliverable:** Acquisition research summary and refined screening criteria

## Week 13: Apr 20-25
**Focus:** Recommendation synthesis & prioritization

- Consolidate portfolio, cost, and acquisition insights into clear recommendations
- Prioritize recommendations by impact, feasibility, and risk
- Tighten narrative flow from diagnostics to strategy
- Identify any remaining gaps or sensitivities

**Deliverable:** Draft prioritized recommendation set

## Week 14: Apr 27-May 2
**Focus:** Finalization & presentation prep

- Finalize consulting-style presentation deck
- Refine visuals, tables, and supporting analysis
- Conduct practice presentations and incorporate feedback
- Prepare appendix and backup material

**Deliverable:** Near-final presentation deck ready for review

## Week 15: May 4-6
**Focus:** Capstone showcase & delivery

- Deliver final presentation
- Submit final project materials
- Archive models, data, and documentation for PHMS
- Document key takeaways and lessons learned

**Deliverable:** Final presentation and complete project submission
